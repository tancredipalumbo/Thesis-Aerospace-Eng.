# Thesis Aerospace Engineering

## Description
This project represents my undergraduate thesis in Aerospace Engineering. The tool developed is designed for the analysis of rocket **staging** for a Mars mission. The main objective is to provide a platform to calculate and analyze the various phases of launch and interplanetary navigation, optimizing rocket performance.

## Features
- **Launch Phase Analysis**: Evaluation of different phases of a rocket, including details on each stage.
- **Flight Simulation**: Execution of simulations to determine the effectiveness of the rocket's configuration during flight.
- **Performance Optimization**: Tools to improve rocket efficiency through modifications in design and flight parameters.
- **Automatically Generated Reports**: Creation of detailed reports on the conducted analysis, with graphs and tables for easy data interpretation.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy (and other relevant libraries)
- Development Environment: [specify the environment, e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, etc.]
